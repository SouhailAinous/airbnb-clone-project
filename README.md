- Implement CI/CD pipelines for deployment
- Learn team collaboration and documentation practices

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Django
- MySQL
- Django REST Framework
- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- GraphQL 
## Team Roles

Below are the typical roles involved in a backend development project like the Airbnb Clone. These roles help ensure collaboration, structure, and clear responsibilities.

### 🔧 Backend Developer
Responsible for writing the server-side logic of the application. Builds and maintains the APIs, handles data processing, and ensures proper communication with the database.

### 🗄️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database structure. Ensures data is stored securely, efficiently, and is always accessible. Works with the backend developer to create the data models.

### 🔐 Security Engineer
Implements security protocols like authentication, authorization, and protection against common threats (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Ensures data privacy and secure API transactions.

### 🚀 DevOps Engineer
Handles deployment and CI/CD pipelines. Uses tools like Docker and GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deploying the app to production.

### 📚 Technical Writer / Documentation Lead
Writes clean documentation for other developers and users. Maintains the README, API docs, and onboarding instructions.

### 🧑‍💻 Team Lead / Project Manager
Coordinates the team, sets deadlines, assigns tasks, and ensures that the team follows best practices. Also communicates between the team and external stakeholders (if any).
## Technology Stack

Here are the main technologies used in this project and their purposes:

### 🐍 Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build backend services quickly. It handles routing, database models, authentication, and more.

### 🛢️ MySQL
A relational database system used to store structured data like users, listings, and bookings. Django connects to this to fetch or save data.

### 🔌 Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension of Django that makes it easier to build RESTful APIs. It helps serialize data and create CRUD operations efficiently.

### 📦 Docker
A containerization tool that packages your app and its environment into isolated units, making it easier to develop and deploy.

### 🧪 GitHub Actions
A CI/CD tool that automates testing, building, and deploying your code whenever you push updates.

### 🔐 JWT (or other auth method)
Used for user authentication and session management. Ensures only authorized users can access certain resources.

### 🧬 GraphQL *(if included)*
An alternative to REST APIs that lets clients request only the data they need. It improves flexibility and reduces over-fetching.

### 📝 Markdown
Used to write documentation like this README. It’s a lightweight syntax for formatting plain text.

### 🧠 Git & GitHub
Version control tools used to track changes, collaborate with a team, and store code safely online.
## 🗄️ Database Design

Here are the main entities (tables) used in the Airbnb Clone project, along with their key fields and relationships:

### 👤 Users
Stores information about people using the platform.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Full name
- `email`: Email address
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password
- `is_host`: Boolean to check if user is a host

### 🏠 Properties
Represents the listings available for booking.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `owner_id`: Foreign key to Users (who owns this property)
- `title`: Name of the listing
- `location`: City and address
- `price_per_night`: Cost of booking per night

### 📅 Bookings
Tracks who booked which property and when.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key to Users
- `property_id`: Foreign key to Properties
- `start_date`: When the booking starts
- `end_date`: When the booking ends
- `total_price`: Calculated cost

### 💬 Reviews
Allows users to leave feedback on properties.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key to Users
- `property_id`: Foreign key to Properties
- `rating`: Numerical score (e.g., 1 to 5)
- `comment`: Text feedback

### 💳 Payments
Stores transaction data for bookings.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: Foreign key to Bookings
- `amount`: Total amount paid
- `status`: Paid / Failed / Refunded
- `payment_method`: e.g., credit card, PayPal

---

### 🔗 Entity Relationships

- A **User** can create multiple **Properties** (1-to-many)
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings** (1-to-many)
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**
- A **User** can leave multiple **Reviews** for different **Properties**
- A **Payment** is linked to one **Booking**
  ## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

Here are the core features of the Airbnb Clone and how they contribute to the platform:

### 👤 User Management
Allows users to register, log in, update their profiles, and manage their account settings. Includes secure authentication, session management, and user role (guest or host) identification.

### 🏘️ Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Listings include details like location, images, amenities, pricing, and availability. This feature is essential for allowing guests to browse and find suitable places.

### 📅 Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties for specific dates. The system handles booking creation, date validation (no double bookings), price calculation, and cancellation policies.

### 💳 Payment Integration
Handles secure payment processing when a guest books a property. Supports payment methods like credit cards and tracks the status of each transaction.

### 💬 Review & Rating System
After a stay, guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This helps maintain trust and quality across the platform by allowing feedback.

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
Only logged-in users can access certain features (e.g., booking, reviewing, or listing properties). Admins and hosts have different levels of access.

### 🚀 CI/CD Integration
Automated deployment and testing workflows using tools like GitHub Actions and Docker. Ensures consistent development, testing, and production environments.

### 🛡️ Security Measures
Protects the platform from vulnerabilities using best practices like input validation, encrypted passwords, and access control. Ensures the safety of both user data and transactions.
## 🔐 API Security

Ensuring the security of backend APIs is critical to protect user data, prevent abuse, and maintain trust in the platform. Below are the key security measures that will be implemented:

### 🔑 Authentication
Only registered users should access certain features like bookings and reviews. We’ll implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify user identity with each API request.

> **Why?** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing protected resources like user dashboards or host tools.

### 🛂 Authorization
We’ll implement role-based access control to ensure that only specific users (e.g., hosts or admins) can perform certain actions like adding a property or managing users.

> **Why?** Prevents guests from modifying or deleting listings they don’t own.

### 🚫 Rate Limiting
APIs will be protected from abuse or brute-force attacks by limiting how many requests a user or IP can make in a given time.

> **Why?** Helps protect login and payment endpoints from being spammed or attacked.

### 🔒 Data Encryption
Sensitive data like passwords and payment information will be securely encrypted using industry standards (e.g., bcrypt for passwords, HTTPS for all API traffic).

> **Why?** Prevents data leaks and secures private user information during transmission and storage.

### 🧪 Input Validation
All user input (e.g., forms, search queries) will be validated to prevent malicious injections (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

> **Why?** Protects the database and frontend from being manipulated or attacked via crafted input.

### 🧼 CORS Configuration
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies will be set up to allow safe communication between frontend and backend while blocking unauthorized origins.

> **Why?** Prevents frontend attacks from untrusted websites or sources.

These security practices ensure the system is safe, stable, and trustworthy for all users and transactions.
